# Angular Extended Builders

<!-- Keep intro section in sync with all projects -->

> Package is forked/copied and heavily inspired by https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders

I just build this package to provide/implement a more modern base for https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders and to extend it to my needs wherever I need to.

> [!CAUTION]
> I use this project for my needs and my companies Angular projects, it does not guarantee to work with your project nor do I want to implement edge cases. Please refer to angular-builders if you need that type of stability.
